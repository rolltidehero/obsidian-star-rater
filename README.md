# Obsidian Star Rater
A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that replaces your new tab window with a card layout of the files in each folder organized by star rating. The view is filterable with an inbuilt search field (just start typing!), and files can be assigned a star rating from 1-5 stars from a prominent menu within the note.
